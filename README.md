# Isomorphic React

### About The Application
This application is a basic API client which gathers data from an outside API (in this case, Stackoverflow) and generates an isomorphic, single-page application (SPA).

### Why Isomorphic React?
Great question!
- Uses React / Redux as main application engine
- Supports hot reloading and server rendering!
- Uses React Router

1) Clone the repository
2) install dependencies
`npm install && npm run postinstall`
